        A user can create an account.
        Both roles are allowed - admin or user - to create.
        Everyone can freely choose a role he or she wants for testing purposes.
        Admin entity has more previleges, i.e manage goods, see order history of
        all users, etc.
        User entity can only buy goods from the shop and access it's own orders
        history.
        By pressing "Confirm" button, a user "Pays" for the order, the order
        gets recorded to the DB.
